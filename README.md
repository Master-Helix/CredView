## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Setup

1. **Database Setup (PostgreSQL)**  
   - Create a PostgreSQL database for Credit Card data.
   - Upload transactional and customer datasets using `.csv` files or SQL insert scripts.
   - Tables Example:
     - `customer.csv`
     - `credit_card`
   - Performed data cleaning and transformations via SQL queries.
   - Performed addition of data in real-time with the data files labelled as `cc_add.csv` and `cust_add.csv`

2. **Connect PostgreSQL to Power BI**  
   - Use the **PostgreSQL connector** inside Power BI.
   - Import necessary tables and views.
   - Perform additional modeling (relationships, calculated columns, and measures) along with **DAX Queries** to create new columns and generate valuable insights.

3. **Build Power BI Dashboard**  
   - Create custom visuals like:
     - KPI Cards (e.g., Total Spend, Transaction Value, Total Revenue, Average Customer Satisfaction Score)
     - Customer Segmentation
     - Credit Utilization by Card Type

4. **Export Data to Excel**  
   - Export processed and visualized data tables to Excel via Power BI options.
   - Share reports for non-Power BI users.
